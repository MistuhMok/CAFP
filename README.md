Consensys Academy Final Project

[] Record your screen as you demo the application, showing and explaining how you included the required components.
1. Project includes a README.md that explains the project
2. The project is a Truffle project that allows you to easily compile, migrate and test the provided Solidity contracts
3. Project is commented as outline in the documentation
4. At least one contract uses a library or inherits from another contract
5. I can run the app on a development server locally for testing/grading (or connecting to Rinkeby/Ropsten if required)
6. The app displays the current ethereum account
7. I can sign transactions using Metamask (or another web3 provider)
8. The app interface reflects updates to to the contract state
9. 5 tests written in Javascript or Solidity (or both)
- [] Tests are properly structured
- [] All tests pass
10. At least one of the contracts implements a circuit breaker / emergency stop pattern.
11. Project includes a file called design_pattern_decisions.md that adequately describes the design patterns implemented in the project
12. Project includes a file called avoiding_common_attacks.md that explains at least 2 common attacks and how the app mitigates user risk.
13. Project includes a file called deployed_addresses.txt that describes where the deployed testnet contracts live (which testnet and address)
