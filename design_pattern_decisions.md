I chose to create a Factory contract to deploy each store so that the individual would have to manage and handle the costs of their own store and would not require approval to create a store. An individual would have to deploy and stock their store with items of their choosing. The items are saved as state contract variable because it is important to constantly have up to date information on the number of sales vs the number in the initial inventory to prevent overselling. The factory contract uses a mapping of a user's address to an array of all the deployed store addresses by that user. The store also has a pausable feature to prevent people from buying at the owner's discretion. A user can purchase items from a store and the funds will be transferred directly to the store owner.
